How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
**I ensure that I gather all relevant information from the clients or stakeholders on what they want in their program. 
I then turn this into User Stories by answering what "type of user", what they "want it to do" and what "goal they want to achieve.**

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
**I approach developing programs by knowing exactly what the user wants in their program. However, one of the most important
agile principle for me to understand is that the project can change at anytime. I will prepare myself by understanding 
that I must be flexible and communicate constantly.**

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
**A good team member works together with all members of their team. They understand the importance of active communication
and that everyone's opinion matters. A good team member works as part of the team and does not try and do everything
how they want and by themselves.**
